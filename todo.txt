1. Figure out how to get unstructured.io to read images into text - quickly...
2. Drag and drop upload
3. Post-process Q&A sets, (e.g. replace [NEWLINE] with \n) - Do postprocessing on Q&A responses. (e.g. if answer just has A: ..., remove the invalid answer and question)
4. CSS padding different in production server?
5. Number the questions (Q&A) generated (frontend).
