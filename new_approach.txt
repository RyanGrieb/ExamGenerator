Instead of doing the rectangle BS. Keep The |tokens| like this, but enumerate with page numbers like you wanted:

===Page:1===
...|tokens|
===Page:1===

Then form the chunks based on page number increments. If the text length is too big, just reduce the pages we include by 1.
USE: https://github.com/openai/tiktoken to count the number of tokens/text length!!!!!!!!!!

After this, just have the prompt: 
You are an expert in parsing unformatted documents, where text can be out-of-order and confusing. Generate 0 to 5 questions and answers (Q&A), on each page from the provided unformatted text, using this format:
p_n-Q: ...
p_n-A: ...



THEN VALIDATE THE RESPONSE FROM GPT, ensuring it responded in our proper format. If not, re-prompt it.
